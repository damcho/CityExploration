City Explorer is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to discover and explore cities from around the world. Built with modern iOS development practices, the app provides an intuitive interface for searching through a comprehensive database of over 200,000 cities worldwide.

## Features

### üîç CitySearch Feature

The CitySearch feature is the core functionality of City Explorer, providing users with powerful city discovery capabilities:

- **Interactive Map Integration**: View selected cities on an integrated Google Maps interface with precise location markers
- **Smart Search Results**: Cities are automatically sorted alphabetically by name and country for easy browsing
